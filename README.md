# takt11800 - Compaq MX 11800 QMK/VIA Replacement PCB
![Default Layout](https://github.com/vuckale/takt11800/blob/master/docs/overview.png "Overview")

This project is a **drop-in replacement PCB** designed for the **Compaq MX 11800**, also known as the **Cherry G80-11800** a classic mechanical keyboard featuring **Cherry MX Brown switches** and an integrated **trackball**.

Originally designed for use in server rooms and rack-mounted setups, the MX 11800's **compact, space-saving layout** made it a go-to choice in enterprise environments.

### Project Features

- **Powered by QMK Firmware** – Fully customizable keymaps, layers, macros, and lighting effects.
- **VIA Support** – Seamless configuration through the user-friendly VIA interface.
- **Trackball Support** – Full functionality for the integrated pointing device.
- **Drop-In Compatible** – No case modifications required. Designed to fit directly into the original shell and work with original components.
- **USB-C Connectivity** – Modern convenience and reliability.

### Why This Project?

The original MX 11800 has aged gracefully, but its internals were due for a modern upgrade. This replacement PCB brings this legendary board into the modern era while preserving its unique charm and functionality.

Whether you're a retro keyboard enthusiast, a server admin with a soft spot for classic gear, or just someone who loves trackball keyboards, this project gives new life to an iconic piece of hardware.

# Layout

## Default Layout

This PCB supports multiple layout options. The previous image shows the default layout with colored keys and marked unit sizes that support alternate layouts. The default layout represents the configuration the keyboard is most commonly found in: ANSI enter with a 2.25u enter key, stepped caps lock, and a winkeyless 7u bottom row.

## Extended Layout

The extended layout adds support for additional four bottom row variations, which are marked on the image with the letters b–e. For easier assembly, these are also labeled on the PCB itself, with unit sizes marked next to the switch holes and a–e marked on the stabilizer holes. Additionally, the extended layout supports a non-stepped caps lock key, ISO enter, split left shift and a backspace and 2u shift that can be split into two 1u keys. The numpad can also be converted into a full 1u macropad.
